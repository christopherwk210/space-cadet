Space Cadet is a framework in progress for developing nostolgic websites that mimic the visual presentation of older versions of the Windows operating system. This project is meant to serve as an easy way for web developers to use modern web technologies to build web interfaces that resemble the styles of computers during the late 90's.

Lovingly named after [this amazing game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Tilt!_Pinball). You can [view the demo here](http://christopherwk210.github.io/space-cadet/).

Usage
---
This will clone the repo and build for production:

    git clone https://github.com/christopherwk210/space-cadet.git && cd space-cadet
    npm install
    npm run build.prod

The production build will minify the output. If you want to build without minifying (for easier debugging) then you can run this instead:

    npm run build.dev
