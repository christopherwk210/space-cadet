Space Cadet
---
Space Cadet is a framework in progress for developing nostolgic websites that mimic the visual presentation of older versions of the Windows operating system. This project is meant to serve as an easy way for web developers to use modern web technologies to build web interfaces that resemble the styles of computers during the late 90's.
